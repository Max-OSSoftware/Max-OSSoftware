### Hi, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹                   <img src="images/maxwell.png" style="margin-right: 100px;" alt="Maxwell image">

I'm a seasoned JavaScript developer with deep expertise in React and HTML, and I also specialize in security testing and pentesting. Over the years, I've worked on various private projects, primarily dealing with legacy systems. Recently, I've transitioned to open-source development, focusing on todayâ€™s modern technologies and trends.

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on creating JavaScript testing libraries, web templates, boilerplates, and React component libraries. I often clone, modify, and enhance existing open-source projects, or build my own from scratch. I'm also integrating AI into some of my projects and continuously expanding my knowledge of the latest development and AI frameworks.

As I continue to grow and contribute, Iâ€™m open to sponsorships and donations to support my work in pushing the boundaries of technology.
